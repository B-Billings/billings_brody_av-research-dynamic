This Life of Time / Beò
It’s all in our hands this life of time
That’s given to us all
It gathers round each night, each morn
We watch it pass and grow
It is all in our hands
It is all in our hands

With every field and rising sea
Can hear the sounds of all
And with every change
We’ll always be
Where hopes not lost but found
It is all in our hands
It is all in our hands

It is all in our hands
It is all in our hands

And we know the change, the change will surely come
Maybe one more trip around the sun
But we’ll gather here where land meets sea
Where we can be as one
And we know the change, the change will surely come
Maybe one more trip around the sun
And we’ll gather here where land meets sea
Where we can be as one
It is all in our hands
We can be as one

It is all in our hands
And we know the change, the change will surely come
This life of time
It can be
It is all in our hands, It is all in our hands
