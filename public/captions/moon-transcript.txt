Bomb / Moon
I was sure that it'll be easier
To clear you from my mind
Struggled with dusty corners
That were filled with fatal bombs
Bomb bomb bomb
Situation got absurd when I stepped on a memory thorn
How I did it to myself?
Bled out heavy, had to break free
From the minefield that you were
Bomb bomb bomb

You let it burn
Spat on the fuze
The tables turned
The screws were loose
I guess you had to learn

I wish you'll fall off from my window
And take a bad trip to the ground, ooh
It'll be my pleasure to see you pressure
Just before you'll break a bone

You're reflecting I'm deflecting
Burning tires to move on
Too many noises clashed our choices
Future came and left like ghosts
No more messing no caressing
Heavy panting on the walls
How I did it to myself?
Craving a hit practice slant sleep
Now my bed is cold and sad

You let it burn
Spat on the fuze
The tables turned
The screws were loose
I guess you had to learn

I wish you'll fall off from my window
And take a bad trip to the ground, ooh
It'll be my pleasure to see you pressure
Just before you break a bone
