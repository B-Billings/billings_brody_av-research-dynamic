# AV Research Assignment
## By Brody Billings

<br>

This is the submission file for Brody Billings AV Research app. This file is based off our team page allowing for the content between the header and footer to be dynamic based on the route that is selected
<br>

A brief summary. This is more complex build than the other but features node routing to the secondary pages for both audio and video accesibilities. The Audio page features a transcription that the user can toggle on and off with a large button or download a text file version of it. The video page features a toggle button for large video control buttons, closed captioning and subtitles for the video with audio.

The overall site has aria tags for screen readers in areas where something may not be 100% clear or could use more information.

Feel free to look at this [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10dlVxhMgElGhbLxynEFAVA6G9BBX4jkN0Ojns-e-QTI/edit?usp=sharing) file for planning and problem solving
